            <p>
              Just like with any other activity, the world of coding is also
              governed by informal rules. Most of these rules are formulated
              over decades. Programming languages often remain in usage for
              longer than their founders expect.
            </p>

            <p>
              Programmers find innovative ways to recreate these languages for
              different purposes. Thus, some static dos and donts are always of
              use in the fluid zone called coding. Normally, a great code has
              three common features: maintainability, dependability, and
              usability. It should also be adaptable enough to be efficient even
              in changing environments. However, before coding even begins, a
              few prerequisites need to be fulfilled in order to provide a solid
              foundation on which readable code can be written.
            </p>

            <h2 class="h-style">PREREQUISITES</h2>
            <p>
              This is easily the most important step of all. In absence of
              these, a code may be inefficient even if it is completed. The
              prerequisites that need to be in place for an efficient code
              covers matters like design and architecture. An important question
              is how development is structured. What is the specific purpose of
              the software? The problem that the code is meant to solve must be
              clear to the developer. What is the design of the individual
              components? Such basic requirements have to be fulfilled when a
              good code is being written.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hoare makes a good point when it comes to assessing software
              design and architecture. Either a code is so simple that there are
              obviously no errors, or a code is so complex that there are no
              obvious errors. Software design is also of importance to clients,
              who can decide if their needs are being adequately addressed. If
              there are some things that architecture cannot take care of, then
              those are handled in the software design phase. A detailed design
              is a good guide for coding.
            </p>

            <p>
              The next step is to measure existing programming languages against
              the requirements to decide on an appropriate one. If needed, a
              mixed routine can be adopted.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once these are met, it becomes easier to follow some established
              good coding practices.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <h3 class="h-style">Commenting</h3>
                <p>
                  Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by
                  programmers, especially for codes that are written by multiple
                  programmers. However, comments reduce the cost of knowledge
                  transfer. Name of the module, purpose of the module,
                  description of the module, original author, modifications and
                  authors who modified code with a description on why it was
                  modified were components of an early commenting practice.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h3 class="h-style">Good Naming Conventions</h3>
                <p>
                  Using good naming conventions is the next step to good coding.
                  Often developers use Y1 or X1 as variables, and then do not
                  replace them with meaningful names. To prevent this confusion
                  and utter waste of time, descriptive names should be used.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h3 class="h-style">Simplicity And Compactness</h3>
                <p>
                  The key to a good code is also simplicity. To achieve a
                  certain result, developers may use complex logic but this
                  should be minimised while writing a good code. The next
                  developer who uses the code may use it for a different purpose
                  and may not even completely understand or utilise the complex
                  logic. Simple code does not always depend on the length of the
                  code. The code must also be conceptually simple. An added
                  advantage is if the code is also suitably compact. More code
                  can be viewed on a page and programmer keystrokes can be
                  reduced.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h3 class="h-style">Portability</h3>
                <p>
                  Another feature of a good code is portability. If the code
                  contains values referring to absolute parameters such as file
                  names, URLs or IP addresses, it will not run on a host that is
                  of a different design. A good programmer will parametrize
                  these variables and configure them so the application can also
                  be run and maintained in a different environment.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h3 class="h-style">Testing</h3>
                <p>
                  Testing is also a necessary part in the process of coding.
                  Test cases must be planned while the code is being written,
                  and they are developed while an application is coded.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h3 class="h-style">Debugging The Code</h3>
                <p>
                  While writing a code, it is necessary to check for errors
                  throughout. Though it is fine for smaller programs to be
                  debugged after they have been written, this becomes a
                  bottleneck for longer programmes. The best practice,
                  therefore, is to debug each module as soon as it has been
                  created.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h3 class="h-style">Deployment</h3>
                <p>
                  Once the code has been written, it has to be deployed. The
                  installation files should be kept to a minimum and updated
                  regularly. Unused code or anything that is not necessary
                  should not be installed.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The best practices for coding are, most of all, designed to reduce
              risk whenever there are chances of it. For a beginner, a few of
              these will not be completely applicable. But as a hard-boiled
              programmer writing numerous codes, all these guidelines will come
              in handy. Since codes can run up to millions of lines at times,
              outdated advice like keep it simple or less is moreis priceless
              and should always be remembered.
